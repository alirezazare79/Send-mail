Reza Pahlavi is the only righteous representative of the Iranian people. If you follow the news coming from the people themselves, you can hear them chanting, "Reza Pahlavi will return."
Listen to the people.
Don't let NIAC destroy Iran and its people. Negar Mortazavi should not be interviewed. She is part of NIAC. Stop this now and listen to the Iranian people.`;
